Like [my own website](https:guinane.xyz/project/this-website), Quinn’s site originated out of a
desire to have a presence online. A place where people can go to read about the things you’ve done
and the things you’re working on.

We sat down one summer’s evening and together built something that could provide Quinn a web-based
resume. Just a handful of `<ul>` tags, the site is simple and to-the-point. Easy to scan for
information and easy to update.

The look of the site is obviously inspired by programming and programming environments. With a
monospace font ([IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)) and
[Solarized colour palette](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/), the site evokes the very IDEs
we were using to write it. It’s a style that I really enjoy, and was looking to get the opportunity
to use for a long time. It felt like the perfect use case.

Now, if you are going to do the "it looks like code" thing, you have to do it right. And there is
only one right way to do it: [soulwire.co.uk](https://soulwire.co.uk).

Soulwire (the personal site of Justin Windle) was probably my first favorite website. The first
time I felt truly delighted by a bit of Javascript and CSS. The opening animation reveals the site’s
content through a cascading flurry of letters and symbols. Somewhere between
[Hackertyper](https://hackertyper.net) and the Matrix, yet tasteful and smooth. I have reloaded that
webpage more times than my browser can count.

As soon as we decided to go for the programmer art direction, I knew I needed to pay homage to the
Soulwire animation (and by "pay homage" I mean completely rip it off).

Opening up Inspect Element, however, I was faced with a hard truth: there’s no copy-paste-able CSS
snippet to steal. Poking around the site’s resources turned up some minified JS, but nothings very
comprehendible. Nothing posted to Github either. I had been in awe of the site since 2017, and
attempting to recreate what to my eyes appeared to be magic felt insurmountably daunting. But there
was no other way.

The final result it close. Like a police sketch of the original animation.
